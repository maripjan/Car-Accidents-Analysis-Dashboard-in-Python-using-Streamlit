# Car Accidents Analysis Dashboard using Streamlit

Comments regarding app.py:

1. The purpose of this project was to create a simple web app (dashboard) that allows users to interactively analyze data 
related to vehicle accidents in NY.

2. In order to run the app:	

	a. Open a terminal

	b. If different, navigate to the directory where app.py is stored
	
	c. Type "streamlit run app.py"
	

3. The list of all libraries and their respective versions that were used to create this project is given in requirements.txt file. Please refer to it in case of a necessity.

4. Original CSV file includes more than 1.6 million incidents of vehicle collisions. However, for the sake of memory saving (and GitLab's 10MB file limit) only 100,000 rows were fed into the application as an input data.
